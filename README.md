- "Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. It's better to spend more time upfront designing and writing clean, readable code than to rush through it and end up with a mess that's difficult to work with later on. Remember, you're not just writing code for yourself, but also for your future self and any other developers who may need to work on the project."
