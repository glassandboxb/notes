- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can ensure that you focus on the critical aspects of the project and not get sidetracked by less significant details. Use a task management tool, such as Trello or Asana, to keep track of your priorities and make sure you stay on track. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial when it comes to programming. You should always have a clear idea of what you want to achieve and how you will go about achieving it. Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks and create a timeline for each task. Then, follow that timeline to make certain that your code is completed on time and within budget. Planning ahead will also help to prevent last-minute panic and stress.  
3. Stay organized: A clean and organized codebase is a happy code base. Make sure that all ofyour code, both commented and uncommented, is well-organized and easy to navigate. Follow coding conventions and use version control systems, like Git,to keep your work organized and trackable. Organized code will not only make your life easier as a programmer but willalso make it easier for others to understand and contribute to your projects.

- "Today's programming wisdom is to embrace the SOLID principles. These five fundamental design guidelines - Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion - encourage writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Always remember: a program that's easy to understand, modify, and extend today will save you time and reduce bugs tomorrow." 

In detail:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one primary responsibility.
2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities like classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use; instead, interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific ones.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions.

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' - Donald Knuth. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code first and optimize only when necessary, after profiling and identifying actual bottlenecks." 

In more detail, this quote emphasizes that over-concern with efficiency early in the development process can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code. It's better to write clear and simple code initially, then improve performance where data-driven analysis indicates it's truly needed. This approach fosters a balance between code readability, maintainability, and efficient execution.

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' — Leonardo da Vinci. Always strive to write clear, concise, and maintainable code that solves the problem at hand without unnecessary complexity. Remember, tomorrow's you (or someone else) will thank you for it." 

In practice, this means:
1. Write modular code that follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
2. Optimize for readability; a well-structured program can often be more efficient in the long run than an initially optimized but hard-to-understand one.
3. Use built-in language features and libraries effectively to avoid reinventing the wheel.
4. Comment your code, but aim to make the comments redundant with clear, self-explanatory code.
5. Test early, test often, and embrace debugging as a learning process to improve your code's quality and simplicity."

Simplicity in code allows for easier maintenance, better collaboration, and reduces the likelihood of bugs. Write clear, concise, and readable code that accomplishes the task at hand without unnecessary complexity. Remember that code is read far more often than it is written, so strive for elegance and clarity over premature optimization or premature abstraction." 

In addition, always consider the SOLID principles for object-oriented design, which are:
1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
2. Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
4. Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

Lastly, automate testing and continuous integration as much as possible to catch errors early and ensure your code remains functional over time."
